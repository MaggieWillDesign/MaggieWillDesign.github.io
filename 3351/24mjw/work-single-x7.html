                  <p class="work-read altp">
                    JustFab’s growth had reached a plateau, as a KPI-centric approach created a fragmented user experience, highlighting the
                    need for a cohesive brand revamp and a more user-centered acquisition strategy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="work-read altp">  On the growth team, I was exposed to a range of acquisition metrics and KPI terminology—CPCs, CPAs,
                    CACs, CPLs, ROAS, AOV, CPMs, LTV, and more. While it was thrilling to work with such data and constantly strive to
                    surpass previous benchmarks, I often wondered if this intense KPI focus was diluting the overall user experience. Our
                    growth strategy also showed clear signs of inefficiency, with a lack of 
                    
                    <a
                      href="../../images/portfolio/xd7/single-20.jpg">design cohesion,
                    </a>
                    bottlenecks, and outdated
                    processes. At first, these concerns seemed secondary, as the business was thriving. However, when growth stalled, the
                    need for fresh, user-centered perspectives became evident.
                  </p>
                  <p class="work-read altp">
                    To commemorate JustFab’s 10th anniversary, the company planned an extensive brand revamp. This involved establishing a
                    new brand identity, including updated fonts, styling, and foundational enhancements to the e-commerce site.
                    Cross-functional collaboration—spanning marketing, creative, merchandising, product, and engineering—presented the ideal
                    moment to also reimagine our prospecting growth experiences, aligning them with a stronger, more unified brand identity.

                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">The Goal</h4> 
    
                  <p class="work-read altp">With a rebrand on the horizon, the objective was to conduct a UX audit of acquisition funnels and develop strategies to
                  resolve design inconsistencies and outdated processes. The focus was on designing and implementing proven, growth-driven
                  solutions to optimize new user conversion rates, and retention through comprehensive research, data analysis, and A/B 
                  testing. The goal is to create user-centric designs that address behaviors, needs, and growth challenges while enhancing
                  usability across all customer prospecting and lead touch points.

              <h3>User Research Summary</h3>
              <p>To begin this project, we set out to gather both quantitative and qualitative insights from users, focusing on the
              experiences of first-time and returning visitors who had not yet converted into leads or completed a purchase.
              
              We then conducted an in-depth analysis of existing data and behavioral analytics, using heatmaps and session recordings
              to identify areas of engagement and points of drop-off in the customer journey.
              
              Additionally, we closely examined NPS data and customer attrition metrics to gain a fuller understanding of user
              satisfaction and retention.

              photography choices that would convert new customers and align with the brand's new visual language. The prototypes also
              showcase how the refined experience is now cohesive for each customer segment.
