                            <p>Marketing efforts within a subscription model rely heavily on efficiently activating customers and capturing leads.
                            Gateway pages are utilized to direct users seamlessly from ads to non-searchable landing pages. When I assumed
                            responsibility for the gateway system, it was quite archaic and cumbersome. Multiple pages were constructed for
                            different screen sizes, and products were hard-coded, lacking personalization. This led to significant bottlenecks,
                            wasted
                            hours, and a disconnect between ad creative and landing page content.
                            
                            Recognizing this issue, I developed responsive Bootstrap templates. I also engineered a solution for utilizing automated
                            product algorithms. Additionally, I introduced more personalized features from ads to lead and member capture. This
                            initiative resulted in a substantial increase in conversions as ad and landing page content became more aligned.
                            Consequently, this endeavor saved countless hours and alleviated challenges for developers, designers, and marketers,
                            greatly satisfying many colleagues.
                            
                            This marked the beginning of my journey and fascination with full-stack development, driven by my desire to address
                            challenges with code and creative problem solving.</p>
