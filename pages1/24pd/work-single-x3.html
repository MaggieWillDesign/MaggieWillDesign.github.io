                  <p class="work-read altp">
                    A growing number of young individuals are choosing self-employment, leveraging the myriad opportunities facilitated by
                    online platforms and tools. The accessibility and versatility of these digital resources have empowered young people to
                    explore diverse avenues for self-employment, ranging from freelancing and consulting to entrepreneurship. This shift
                    reflects not only a desire for flexibility and autonomy but also a response to the evolving landscape of work in the
                    digital age.
                  </p>
              
                  <p class="work-read altp">
                    While the autonomy and flexibility of self-employment offer young individuals unprecedented control over their careers,
                    there's a notable drawback – the potential loss of advantages associated with saving money for retirement through
                    tax-deferred workplace accounts, such as a 401(k). The absence of employer-sponsored retirement plans can pose a
                    challenge for those navigating the realm of self-employment.
                  </p>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">The Goal</h4>
    
                  <p class="work-read altp">Recognizing this gap, there arises an opportunity for a dedicated platform to assist these users in optimizing their
                  retirement savings. Such a platform could provide tailored solutions, offering insights into alternative retirement
                  investment options, guiding them on tax-efficient strategies, and bridging the gap in retirement planning that
                  self-employed individuals often face. By addressing these specific needs, this platform can become an invaluable
                  resource for those navigating the unique financial landscape of self-employment.
                  </p>
                  <p class="work-read altp">The goal is a platform dedicated to offering tailored solutions for individuals navigating the intricate landscape of
                  retirement savings. We go beyond mere investment options, providing a comprehensive array of financial tools and
                  resources designed to empower users in achieving their retirement goals with confidence and clarity. By understanding
                  the specific requirements and goals of the self-employed demographic, this platform strives to empower users with the

            <p>To simplify the app's fundamental structure and intended functionality, paper wireframes were used to
              assist in the
              planning process. Focusing on the core features identified during user research, I quickly sketched
              iterations of each screen.</p>

                    <p class="altp">The independent nature of self-employment often leads individuals to overlook the importance of retirement planning.
                    Without the structure of employer-sponsored retirement programs or guidance from HR departments, many freelancers
                    neglect this critical aspect of financial planning. However, adopting a proactive approach to retirement investing not
                    only secures long-term financial stability but also empowers individuals to take control of their financial futures. The
                    value of the platform lies in its ability to empower numerous users to seize retirement investment opportunities and
                    leverage the benefits of compound interest and tax-deferred growth, thereby enabling them to build substantial
                    retirement funds.</p>
